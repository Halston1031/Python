The Windows shell is called `cmd` ; it runs batch files with the suffix . Linux and other Unix-like systems (including macOS) have many shell programs. The most popular is called `bash` or `sh` . The shell has simple abilities, such as simple logic and expanding wildcard symbols such as into filenames. You can save commands in files called shell scripts and run them later. These might be the first programs you encountered as a programmer. The problem is that shell scripts don‚Äôt scale well beyond a few hundred lines, and they are much slower than the alternative languages."
